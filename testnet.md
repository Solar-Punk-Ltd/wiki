# Bee with testnet

## Developer solution (Go):

- Download bee.zip from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1RMqryKcYxUmZZeJnCi0hlG5AERthp5a6 
- Open bee/cmd/bee
- Run: `go run . start printconfig`
- Copy-paste the content to a new file and save as `bee-testnet.yaml`
- Modify this raws:
    ```
    block-time: "15"
    blockchain-rpc-endpoint: "https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com"
    bootnode: ['/dnsaddr/testnet.ethswarm.org']
    config: bee-testnet.yaml
    data-dir: ~/.bee-testnet
    mainnet: false
    network-id: "10"
    password: <your password> //not necessary, but its more comfortable when you donâ€™t need it type in always
    ```
- Save the `bee-testnet.yaml` to `bee/cmd/bee`
- `go run . start --debug-api-enable --config bee-testnet.yaml --cors-allowed-origins="*"`

Check it with swarm-cli status or run bee-dashboard

## General solution:

Goerli testnet not working properly, not connecting to other peers. Sepolia only working in the current development version.

- Download Bee
- Make it executable (`chmod -x && open -a`)
- Change the config file as mentioned above, save it
    ```
    ./bee start --debug-api-enable --config bee-testnet.yaml --cors-allowed-origins="*"
    ```

- Be aware of the naming and placing of config files and data-dir. When changing the config file new overlay address is generated, so data-dir should be backuped and deleted, otherwise bee will hangup with overlay address mismatch.
